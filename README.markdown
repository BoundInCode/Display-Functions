# Function Copier

###Finds an objects type, adds the methods of the object into the autocomplete box, and actives autocomplete

###Problems: I can't seem to add anything into the autocomplete (something worked once, but it was a fluke and I can't reproduce); I don't know how to search through a different file (see comments for more info)
